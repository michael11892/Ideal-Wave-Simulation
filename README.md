# Ideal-Wave-Simulation
This is a project providing code for the simulation of wave interference in matlab. The size of the plane used,
the number of sources, the amplitude, period, location, initialisation time and phase of each source can be specified by the user.
Note that since this is WIP, some provided scripts as of now aren't fully functional yet.
