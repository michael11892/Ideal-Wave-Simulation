# Ideal-Wave-Simulation
This is a project providing code for the simulation of wave interference in matlab. The size of the plane used,
the number of sources, the amplitude, period, location, initialisation time and phase of each source can be specified by the user.
Note that since this is WIP, some provided scripts as of now aren't fully functional yet (these can be found in separate branches).

# Issues
So far, although the simulation is working, its performance is non ideal. This can be solved through multithreading
but the fix hasnt been implemented yet
